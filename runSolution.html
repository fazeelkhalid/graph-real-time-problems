<h3>-------------Sample run for the graph on the slide for topological sorting. </h3>
Note that the program produced the same start and finish time and the same vertex order (6,4,2,3,0,1,5). For grading and correctness checking, make sure you have the same mapping between course names and vertex numbers as shown in this sample run.
